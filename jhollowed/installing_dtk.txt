To install dtk, you just need to add it to the system's python path;

1. Open ~/.bash.rc

2. Add or modify the PYTHONPATH line by adding the directory containing dtk to the path string, separated by a colon. For example, if dtk was located at

	~/tools/dtk

   and your ./bashrc currently has a line

	export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}"

   add the path to dtk like so

	export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:~/tools/"

** dtk must be run with python2.x **
